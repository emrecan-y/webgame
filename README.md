# Webgame

I want to use this repository to build a web game using Spring Boot and React. My goal is to learn more about bidirectional communication in web development.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Spring Boot
- **Frontend**:
  - `React`
  - `TypeScript`
  - `Tailwind CSS`
  - `stompjs` -> `react-stomp-hooks`
  - `react-router`
  - `zustand` (used in a single use case, not globally)
  - `@2toad/profanity`

## Things I've Learned

- Using `motion` for animations
- Implementing WebSockets with `STOMP`
- Setting up basic CI/CD in GitHub Actions, deploying from GHCR
- Setting up a server on AWS EC2 with reverse proxy and SSL; automating setup with bash scripts
- My first project developed over a long time frame -> working to keep the code clean and consistent

## Features

The requirements I initially chose for this project were:

- A lobby system where you can create or join existing lobbies
- A lobby chat feature
- A simple multiplayer game

### Current Features

- Easy login using a nickName, allowing the game to be used without requiring registration. Names can be auto-generated by the backend or customized.
  - **Profanity check**: Names are checked for profanity (this could be optimized, as partial matches can result in unnecessary hits).
- The user session only exists while the WebSocket connection is active.
- Users can create or join existing lobbies. When a lobby is created, the user is automatically joined. If a lobby is empty, it is deleted.
- Lobbies can be either globally accessible or protected with a password.
- When a lobby is full, a game can be started.
- A global chat is available to all logged-in users. Each lobby also has its own chat, which is available only to users in that lobby.
  - Profanity checked aswell.
  - Chat messages are automatically deleted after 15 minutes.

## Future Improvements

- Optimize background animation. It is using simple css and is very resource-intensive.
- Optimize profanity filter to avoid partial matches.
- Add more game modes and features.
- Optimizing across platforms, used Mac and Android for testing.
